# MPhil-Thesis-R-Scripts
Here you can find the scripts I used for the statistical analysis of my MPhil Thesis data.
The files are numbered and named after the headings within the results section of my thesis.
The additional model assessing predictors of baseline mental health scores can also be found here.

## Explanation of variables
### Demographic variables
Most demographic variables are intuitive (Age = "age", etc).
### Timepoints
For variables recorded at a certain timepoint, that timepoint is encompassed in the variable name as follows: "variable_timepoint". Timepoints are: baseline = "base", post-intervention = "post", 1-year follow-up = "fu1", 2-year FU = "fu2", 3-year FU = "fu3.
### Mental health scores
CORE-OM and WEMWBS scores are referred to as "core_" and "wb_" with the respective timepoint in the variable name.
### Practice
Formal practice is abbreviated as "formal_" and informal practice is abbreviated as "informal_". "formal_total_" indicates that this variable contains all practice done after the course finished up to that timepoint.
